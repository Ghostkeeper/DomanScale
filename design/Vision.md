Vision & High Level Design Constraints
====
This document describes the high-level design constraints of the game and why these constraints were chosen. A lot of this is about personal preference and the vision for this game, so not all of it is completely rational. The vision described here is the root of why the game is designed the way it is.

Motivation
----
This project is started by Ghostkeeper out of many different motivations. The main motivations are all personal:
- He wants to develop himself as a programmer in a wider application area.
- He wants to develop his skill in pixel art.
- He wants to build a system for automatic music generation, and needed a fun place to apply that in.

Less personal motivations also come into play:
- Games with large decision trees and real impact of your moral decisions are fun, and there aren't enough of them in the world.

Retro-style game
----
This game will have a classical look and feel, reminiscent of games from the 90's.

This allows the game to last for a long time. It's not likely that this game will be developed quickly or timely, so using high-technological modern techniques to develop it will likely cause those techniques to be outdated before the game is released. Using a retro style however is more timeless; it will still be retro years down the road. It is more likely to make a lasting impact in the long term, and reduces pressure on the expedience of development.

What's more, this allows the developers to develop their skill in pixel art, and makes it easier to implement automatic music generation by leveraging MIDI.

Role-playing game
----
This is a role-playing game. Role-playing games allow for a lot of storytelling, which is fun to play and to design. Storytelling makes the writing stage interesting to do as well. It will require a lot of art. Role-playing games combined with pixel art will be reminiscent of a lot of popular games such as the Legend of Zelda, which will attract an audience.

Role-playing games often have some sort of character growth (driven by the story, as well as through items found in the game) and character customisation. The character customisation is somewhat limited though, for these reasons:
- The character name cannot be customised. This allows for art to mention the name, such as books, signs or even audio. This also allows for easier sharing / memes online, if it ever gets popular.
